# Welcome to LATAI - Learning AI Through AI

## üåé About the LATAI Community

LATAI (**Learning AI Through AI**) is a Latin community for AI. We are an open-source community dedicated to exploring and mastering Artificial Intelligence by actively using AI tools to generate software, documentation, and research. Instead of just reading about AI, we **learn by doing AI**, leveraging AI-powered automation in every aspect of our projects.

Our aim is to have a **FREE/GRATIS** way for any person in Latin America to learn AI by doing software projects and proof-of-concepts fully assisted by AI. This means creating **real-world software libraries and proof-of-concepts (POCs)**, all while documenting and analyzing how AI contributes to the software development lifecycle.

## üöÄ What is the Goal of LATAI?

Our core objective is to **develop software using AI-assisted workflows, tools, and code generation**. We focus on building **tools, libraries, and AI-driven experiments**, where AI generates:

1. **Code** (more than 90% AI-generated, humans only review and refine).
2. **Project Documentation** (epics, stories, designs, and data models).
3. **QA & Testing** (AI-driven test cases, test automation, and verification).

Every project, POC, and experiment will be public and open-source, allowing **everyone to contribute, learn, use, and improve** together.

## üìå How LATAI Works

LATAI is structured into different repositories and communication platforms:

### **GitHub Organization: [LATAI-Community](https://github.com/latai-community/)**

LATAI will have multiple repositories that we will update during the coming months/years. Initially, we have:

- **JPC** - A Java + Python + CMD Shell library for handling files, text automation, and simple/common utilities.
- **POCs** - AI Proof-of-Concept projects to explore AI tools.
  - `POC_Claude_1`: The first POC to test AI model capabilities of Claude Agent with a very simple UseCase/Example.
- **Latai-Structure**
  - `Latai-Website` - Landing page for community information.
  - `Latai-Docs` - Guides, governance, and documentation.

## üåü Our Vision

We believe that **AI has the power to revolutionize software development**, and Latin America has a unique opportunity to become a key player in this transformation. However, we acknowledge that learning AI can be a complex and challenging journey. That‚Äôs why we are committed to providing Latinos with a completely **free and hands-on learning experience**, where they can develop AI skills through real projects and experimentation.

Our vision is to make LATAI the **go-to community** for students and professionals in Latin America who are beginning their AI journey. By fostering collaboration, sharing knowledge, and actively engaging with AI tools, we aim to break barriers, innovate, and **build AI-powered software while learning together**.
